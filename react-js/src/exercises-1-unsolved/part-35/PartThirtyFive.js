// TODO: - read introduction
// The idea for this app is to make another German/English language learning game :).
// But a bit different from the previous one

// We want to have something like:
// - 4 buttons show up on one side, each a random German word in them
// - 4 buttons show up next to these, each with an English translation
//   of one of the German words in the first set of buttons

// The object of the game is to match the German words with the correct
// English translation

// TODO: - lets discuss how we want the game to work exactly before starting

// TODO: first steps:
// 1 - Look at data.js, import the wordData array from it into this file

// 2 - Create a state variable called currentWords

// 3 - We need to set the initial values of currentWords to
// an array of 4 random entries from the wordData array. Look in utils.js,
// complete the function in there and then use that to set the initial value of
// the currentWords variable, e.g:
// const [currentWords, setCurrentWords] = useState(generatedFourRandomWords(wordData));

const PartThirtyFive = () => {
  return (
    <div>Hello</div>
  );
};

export default PartThirtyFive;
