// TODO:
// The idea for this app is to make a little German/English language learning game :).
// For the first part we want to have something like:
// - German word appears at the top of the page
// - In an input box below that, the player has to write the correct English translation
// - Then there is a button to submit the answer
// - Then the user gets shown if it was correct or not and a button to go to the next question

// TODO:
// 1 - Look at data.js, import the wordData array from it into this file

// 2 - Display the first german word from the array in the component below

// 3 - Add an input element, linked to a state variable called userAnswer

// 4 - Add a button with the text 'Submit', when clicked check if the userAnswer
// matches the english translation of the german word

// 5 - ask me for next steps

const PartThirtyFour = () => {
  return (
    <div>Hello</div>
  );
};

export default PartThirtyFour;

// Potential future tasks:
// - Capitalise the German word before displaying it
// - Add a skip/show answer button
// - Keep track of score
