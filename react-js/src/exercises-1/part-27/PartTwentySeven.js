// TODO: part 1
// Have a look at the data/countries-db.json file
// Next, look at the package.json scripts section
// What command do we have to run to start our server that hosts the countries data?

// TODO: part 2
// Make a small app that has the following behaviour:
// 1 - fetches data from 'http://localhost:3000/countries'
// 2 - displays a list of countries, including their name and their capital, like:
//     Name: Afghanistan
//     Capital: Kabul
// 3 - look into part-27-next-steps.txt for further tasks
