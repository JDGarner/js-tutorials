Next steps for part 27:

1) - Add an input element
      - store the value of what you type in here in a state variable
      - hide any country that doesn't contain in it's name the value that you typed
          (or another way to say this - Only show countries that in their name include the value of that input)

1.5) - Make it so the search is case insensitive
      (e.g. I can search united k and it will show United Kingdom)


2) - Add a button that shows up next to each country, with the text 'Select'
   - When this button is clicked, set the country that is selected as a state variable
   - Display this country next to the countries list, with the title 'My Country: '


3) - Add a button that shows up next to each country, with the text 'Add to favourites'
   - When this button is clicked, add that countries to a favouriteCountries array that is a state variable
   - If there are any countries in the favouriteCountries array, render them all out
      (below My Country but above Countries List)


4) - if a country is in the favourites list, dont show it in the countries list


5) - Add a button with the text 'Remove from favourites'.
   - Make it so this button just shows next to favourited countries
   - When clicked, update the favouritesList to remove the country that was clicked from the list



To do next time:
