Next steps for part 28:

1) - At the moment, our password is showing in plain text,
google how to hide text input for password in html to get it so we can hide our password

2) - Add another state variable called isSignedIn, set the initial value to false

3) - Add another state variable called error, set the initial value to null

4) - In the onClickSignedIn function:
      - If the username is 'Felcraft' and password is 'creamy', then:
        - set isSignedIn to true
      - Else:
        - set error to 'Invalid username or password'


5) - If the the user is signed in, display a message saying 'Welcome Felcraft!'

6) - If there is an error, display that error in an h5 element below your submit button

7) - Consult me for next steps :)
