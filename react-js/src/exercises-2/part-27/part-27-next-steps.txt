Next steps for part 27:

1) - Extract the name and capital elements into their own component called Country

2) - Display the 'emoji' property of the country data next to the country name

3) - Add a button that when clicked, makes it so only countries that start
with the letter 'L' are shown

4) - Add another button that when clicked, makes it so all countries are showing
again

5) - Add an input element
      - store the value of what you type in here in a state variable
      - hide any country that doesn't contain in it's name the value that you typed
            (or another way to say this - Only show countries that in their name include the value of that input)
