Next steps for part 27:

1) - Extract the name and capital elements into their own component called Country

2) - Display the 'emoji' property of the country data next to the country name

3) - Add a button that when clicked, makes it so only countries that start
with the letter 'L' are shown

4) - Add another button that when clicked, makes it so all countries are showing
again

5) - Add an input element
      - store the value of what you type in here in a state variable
      - hide any country that doesn't contain in it's name the value that you typed
            (or another way to say this - Only show countries that in their name include the value of that input)


6) - Add a button that shows up next to each country, with the text 'Select'
   - When this button is clicked, set the country that is selected as a state variable
   - Display this country next to the countries list, with the title 'My Country: '


7) - Add a button that shows up next to each country, with the text 'Add to favourites'
   - When this button is clicked, add that countries to a favouriteCountries array that is a state variable
   - If there are any countries in the favouriteCountries array, render them all out
      (below My Country but above Countries List)



Options:
1 - Make it so the search is case insensitive (e.g. I can search united k and it will show United Kingdom)

1.5 - Rename onClickSelectMyFavouriteCountries to onClickAddCountryToFavourites as this is a more accurate name
      for what the function is doing

2 - Instead of rendering new divs for the 'my country' and the 'favourite countries',
    render the <Country component that you already made.
    The difference with these is that you don't want the buttons to show ('Select Country' and 'Add to favourites')
    To do this:
    - Don't pass in the functions onClickSelectMyCountry and onClickSelectMyFavouriteCountries
    - Then inside the function use a ternery statement to check if the function is passed in then show the button
      otherwise just show null

4 - if a country is in the favourites list, dont show it in the countries list

5 - Button to remove favourites

To do:

3 - Add a button to the top of the page, with the text 'Show more info'
  - When clicked, there will be extra info/data shown about the 'My Country' country
